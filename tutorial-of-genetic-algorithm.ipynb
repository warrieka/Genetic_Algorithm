    "\n",
    "* This theory has inspired evolutionary computation to solve optimization problems, feature selection, classic knapsack problem, and many more. The knapsack problem has been studied for more than a century, with early works dating as far back as 1897. The name \"knapsack problem\" dates back to the early works of the mathematician Tobias Dantzig (1884–1956),and refers to the commonplace problem of packing the most valuable or useful items without overloading the luggage.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Let’s understand the application of the genetic algorithm with a knapsack problem. The knapsack problem is a problem in combinatorial optimization: Given a set of items, each with a weight and a value, determine the number of each item to include in a collection so that the total weight is less than or equal to a given limit and the total value is as large as possible. It derives its name from the problem faced by someone who is constrained by a fixed-size knapsack and must fill it with the most valuable items. The problem often arises in resource allocation where the decision-makers have to choose from a set of non-divisible projects or tasks under a fixed budget or time constraint, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* For example: Suppose we are on a treasure hunt, and after all the efforts and hard work, we finally find the treasure in a deep-down cave full of gold and diamond ornaments. The first thing we desire to do is fill our backpack with as many ornaments as possible. However, a few parameters have to be taken care of in our problem, and our backpack has limited space. It cannot carry a weight of more than 35 kilograms.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Next, we have to choose the ornaments optimally such that the backpack is not overloaded, all the ornaments we choose must be highly valued, and one ornament should not damage the other within the backpack — this where a genetic algorithm comes into play to optimize our problem by taking care of all the parameters.\n",

    "# Optimization\n",
    "* In optimization, we start with some kind of initial values for the variables used in the experiment. Because these values may not be the best ones to use, we should change them until getting the best ones. In some cases, these values are generated by complex functions that we cannot solve manually easily. But it is very important to do optimization because a classifier may produce a bad classification accuracy not because, for example, the data is noisy or the used learning algorithm is weak but due to the bad selection of the learning parameters initial values. As a result, there are different optimization techniques suggested by operation research (OR) researchers to do such work of optimization. According to, optimization techniques are categorized into four main categories:\n",

We can benefit from such already existing natural systems and their natural evolution to create our artificial systems doing the same job. This is called bionics. For example, the plane is based on how the birds fly, radar comes from bats, submarine invented based on fish, and so on. As a result, principles of some optimization algorithms comes from nature. For example, Genetic Algorithm (GA) has its core idea from Charles Darwin’s theory of natural evolution “survival of the fittest”. Before getting into the details of how GA works, we can get an overall idea about evolutionary algorithms (EAs). \n",

This technique is efficient and works very well for single-peaked objective functions like the cost function in linear regression. But, in most real-world situations, we have a very complex problem called as landscapes, which are made of many peaks and many valleys, which causes such methods to fail, as they suffer from an inherent tendency of getting stuck at the local optima as shown in the following figure.\n",

Variation-Driven: If there is no acceptable solution in the current population according to the fitness function calculated from each individual, we should make something to generate new better solutions.

    "* Also, each individual has a fitness value. To select the best individuals, a fitness function is used. The result of the fitness function is the fitness value representing the quality of the solution. The higher the fitness value the higher the quality the solution. Selection of the best individuals based on their quality is applied to generate what is called a mating pool where the higher quality individual has higher probability of being selected in the mating pool.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The individuals in the mating pool are called parents. Every two parents selected from the mating pool will generate two offspring (children). By just mating high-quality individuals, it is expected to get a better quality offspring than its parents. This will kill the bad individuals from generating more bad individuals. By keeping selecting and mating high-quality individuals, there will be higher chances to just keep good properties of the individuals and leave out bad ones. Finally, this will end up with the desired optimal or acceptable solution. (As known as elitism: A practical variant of the general process of constructing a new population is to allow the best organism(s) from the current generation to carry over to the next, unaltered. This strategy is known as elitist selection and guarantees that the solution quality obtained by the GA will not decrease from one generation to the next. But here in the real world, things don't work that way. )\n",

There is no new added to it and thus the same drawbacks in its parents will actually exist in the new offspring. To overcome such problem, some changes will be applied to each offspring to create new individuals. The set of all newly generated individuals will be the new population that replaces the previously used old population. Each population created is called a generation. The process of replacing the old population by the new one is called replacement. The following diagram summarizes the steps of GA.\n",

Multiply the gene value with the corresponding alpha value for both the parents and then add the results to generate a single gene of the offspring chromosome. Let’s consider the first gene of each parent chromosome. For parent-1, the gene value is 1, and the corresponding alpha value is also 1; hence, 1x1=1. For parent-2, gene value is 0 and the corresponding alpha value is also 0 hence, 0x0=0. The first gene of the offspring chromosome is 1+0=1, and so on — this way, we get offspring-1, to reproduce the offspring-2, we take the compliment values of alpha and carry out the same process.\n",

    "     * Natural selection can adjust the rate of mutation in a population by acting on allelic variation affecting processes of DNA replication and repair. Because mutation is the ultimate source of the genetic variation required for adaptation, it can be appealing to suppose that the genomic mutation rate is adjusted to a level that best promotes adaptation. Most mutations with phenotypic effects are harmful, however, and thus there is relentless selection within populations for lower genomic mutation rates. Selection on beneficial mutations can counter this effect by favoring alleles that raise the mutation rate, but the effect of beneficial mutations on the genomic mutation rate is extremely sensitive to recombination and is unlikely to be important in sexual populations. In contrast, high genomic mutation rates can evolve in asexual populations under the influence of beneficial mutations, but this phenomenon is probably of limited adaptive significance and represents, at best, a temporary reprieve from the continual selection pressure to reduce mutation. The physiological cost of reducing mutation below the low level observed in most populations may be the most important factor in setting the genomic mutation rate in sexual and asexual systems, regardless of the benefits of mutation in producing new adaptive variation. Maintenance of mutation rates higher than the minimum set by this \"cost of fidelity\" is likely only under special circumstances.

While performing crossover, we replicated the parent chromosomes by mix-matching genes of both the parents. There is no guarantee that the copying of the parent gene is 100% accurate. There always occurs an error, which leads to the scope of exploration.

    "Merging the offsprings is vital for them to be considered as parents to reproduce the next generation. Upon sorting the new population, we have better individuals at the top. Since the population size remains the same as the first iteration(npop), the number of individuals at the bottom of the sorted population equal to the number of new offsprings produced in the previous iteration are eliminated from the selection process to breed new offsprings, and the process continues — this is how the process of elimination takes place.\n",

    "* Secondly, I have benefited greatly from the article written by Sujan Shirol and Roberto Iriondo on the \"towards-ai\" site and even wrote the same. Because it has a really good explanation. However, the codes given in the article do not work properly and are confusing, but they have also developed a solution for it. There is a properly working version of all the code in Colab. However, I think that the return part of the \"bounds\" function in this code may be missing, I added this and I think the code works with higher performance. I also added a simple \"verbose\" function for return results.\n",
